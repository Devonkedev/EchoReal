# Echo

Echo is a digital wellness platform that helps teenagers navigate emotional turbulence through expressive journaling and music-based catharsis. Built around the idea that teens today struggle to communicate emotions in an increasingly individualistic non expressive and desensitized world, Echo provides a safe, structured, and intuitive space for reflection, connection, and healing.

Users begin by selecting a mood emoji and writing journal entries about how they feel on a daily basis. Keeping music, the language of emotional expression, as the medium to enhance emotional processing our algorithm recommends playlists by semantically analyzing lyrics and song vibes to find songs that match not only your mood but also have lyrics that are relatable and reassuring, guiding users from negative to positive emotional states. An accept/reject based UI refines recommendations based on user feedback. Daily journaling streaks and positive reinforcement encourage habit formation and users can also save songs that helped them get through tough times by linking them to entries.

To foster social connection, Echo lets users share journal entries and songs with peer groups or trusted friends to try to make it easier to find the words to express how they feel. Growing peer-to-peer understanding and creating stronger support systems.
