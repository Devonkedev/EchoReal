Living for a brighter day

Together we can stand so tall
Happiness will come to call

Through the light and through the shade
Love will guide us on our way
To a bright and better day`;

Though my heart feels so undone
Better days will surely come

Every scar will make me strong

Let them gently drift away

From anxiety's decree
Peaceful mind and soul at ease
That's the way it's meant to be

Still waters run so deep
In this quiet we can keep
All the wisdom that we need
For our hearts and souls to feed`;

We are stronger than we know
In this journey we will grow

Music soothes the weary soul
Makes the broken spirit whole
In this moment we can see
We are exactly where we need to be`;
